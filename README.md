# ‚öñÔ∏è Optimizing Legal Document Summarization for Enhanced Accessibility in Judicial System

This project presents a complete NLP pipeline to transform complex Indian legal judgments into layperson-friendly summaries. It integrates OCR, rhetorical segmentation, transformer-based summarization (LED), and prompt-based structuring (Meta-LLaMA 8B-Instruct), aiming to bridge the gap between public access and public understanding of court documents.

## üîç Problem Statement

While Indian court judgments are publicly available through platforms like eCourts, their structure and dense legal language make them difficult for the general public to comprehend. There is a clear gap between accessibility and readability, especially for non-legal professionals such as students, journalists, and civil society researchers.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Extract text from scanned/digital Indian court judgments using OCR tools.
- Segment legal content into rhetorical sections: Metadata, Facts, Arguments, Decisions.
- Generate high-quality abstractive summaries using the LED model.
- Restructure outputs using Meta-LLaMA into 6 clearly labeled sections:
  - Background of the Case  
  - Key Legal Issues  
  - Arguments from Both Sides  
  - Court‚Äôs Decision & Reasoning  
  - Impact & Lessons for the Public  
  - Important Takeaways in Simple Terms
- Evaluate summaries using ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.
- Deploy the tool via a Streamlit interface for real-time use.

## üß† Methodology

The project follows a **hybrid CRISP-DM methodology**:

1. **Business Understanding**  
   Bridge the gap between public legal data and non-expert comprehension.

2. **Data Collection & Preparation**  
   - 1,649 court judgments collected from eCourts.  
   - Extracted using PyMuPDF and fallback Tesseract OCR.  
   - Cleaned using regex and NLP libraries.  
   - Segmented into rhetorical structures.

3. **Modeling**  
   - LED (AllenAI) used for abstractive summarization.  
   - Meta-LLaMA 8B-Instruct used for structured generation via custom prompts.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated with ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, BLEU, and BERTScore across 16 test samples.  
   - Manual reference summaries used for comparison.

5. **Deployment**  
   - Interface created using Streamlit.  
   - Publicly accessible via Ngrok tunnel in Colab.

## üìä Evaluation Results

| Metric      | Score  |
|-------------|--------|
| ROUGE-L     | 0.32   |
| BLEU        | 0.105  |
| BERTScore   | 0.81   |

These metrics validate that the model-generated summaries maintain semantic and contextual accuracy comparable to human-written summaries.


## üîÆ Future Enhancements
To improve scalability, accessibility, and real-world applicability, the following future enhancements are planned:

üß† Automated Rhetorical Segmentation
Train a dedicated RSR (Rhetorical Structure Recognition) model using annotated Indian court data to replace heuristic-based segmentation with a data-driven approach.

üåê Multilingual Support
Integrate models like IndicBERT or mBART to handle regional languages (Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, etc.), enabling broader accessibility across India.

‚ö° Latency Optimization
Optimize inference time for LED and LLaMA models to support real-time use cases such as courtroom displays, judicial kiosks, and on-the-fly legal consultations.

üñ±Ô∏è Interactive User Interface
Enhance the Streamlit frontend with section-wise navigation, legal term highlighting, and integrated chatbot support for querying case-specific content.

üìÑ Document Type Expansion
Extend coverage beyond judgments to include contracts, regulatory filings, arbitration awards, and corporate compliance documents.

üßæ Adaptive Prompting
Tailor prompt instructions dynamically based on the case type (e.g., criminal, civil, family law) to improve contextual formatting and tone of summaries.

üîç Explainability Integration
Implement attention visualization and rationale tracing to make the model‚Äôs decisions transparent and trustworthy for legal professionals.

üì± Offline & Mobile Access
Develop lightweight, mobile-compatible deployments for resource-constrained environments, legal clinics, and rural legal aid centers.

üó≥Ô∏è Feedback-Driven Fine-Tuning
Enable continuous improvement via user feedback loops, especially from legal practitioners and NGOs working in the justice domain.
